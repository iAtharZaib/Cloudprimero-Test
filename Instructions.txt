SIMPLE SOCIAL MEDIA APP

Create a bare React native project named ‘TestProject’
Rename the app name to “Cloudprimero Test”
Add a splash screen with a full screen background and a logo in between. (Background and logo are attached)
Setup the libraries for vector icons and react-navigation v5.
The first screen will be a form that will be rendered dynamically based on the data provided in form-data.json file. The required fields are mandatory to be filled. Any validation error should be shown using a Toast. The form data should be handled using state and will be stored in redux once the user fills the form and presses the Submit button. 
Once the user submits the form, his data should be persisted and he should not be shown the form when he launches the app next time.
After successfully submitting the form, the user will be redirected to the next screen i.e. Home screen.
An api will be hit on the Home screen to get the list of posts and the posts will be rendered using a simple UI. The button at the bottom will redirect the user to ‘Add post screen’.
The Add Post screen will have a simple form to take input from the user and after submitting, the post will be added to the list of posts on the Home screen.
Use Product-Sans as font and #442445 as primary color.

Note: Please submit the code in a zip file (without node_modules). Also attach a screen recording of the app (android or ios).
